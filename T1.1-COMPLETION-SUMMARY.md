## ðŸ¤– T1.1 COMPLETION SUMMARY

**COMPLETED BY:** Claude Sonnet 4
**DATE:** 2025-09-25
**STATUS:** Complete

**WHAT WAS BUILT:**
- Complete Go project structure in cmd/, internal/, web/ directories
- Basic HTTP server in cmd/server/main.go serving on :8080
- Package stubs for LXC, tmux, WebSocket, PTY integration
- Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- Go modules configured with go.mod

**SCOPE DISCIPLINE MAINTAINED:**
âœ… NO scope creep beyond Go project foundation
âœ… NO authentication or security features added
âœ… NO actual functionality beyond HTTP server
âœ… NO frontend features beyond basic structure

**BUILD STATUS:**
âœ… go build ./cmd/server compiles successfully
âœ… HTTP server starts and responds on :8080
âœ… All package directories created correctly
âœ… Git repository initialized and ready

**INTEGRATION STATUS:**
âœ… Foundation ready for T1.2 PWA features
âœ… Package stubs ready for T2.1-T2.4 implementation
âœ… Web directory ready for T1.3 CSS framework

**NEXT AI TASKS CAN NOW:**
- T1.2: Add PWA manifest and service worker to web/
- T1.4: Define WebSocket protocol in internal/websocket/
- T2.1: Implement WebSocket handler using foundation structure

**CRITICAL NOTES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER:**
- Do not modify cmd/server/main.go structure - other tasks extend it
- Package interfaces in internal/ are stubs - implement in respective tasks
- Web directory is minimal - T1.2/T1.3 will populate it
